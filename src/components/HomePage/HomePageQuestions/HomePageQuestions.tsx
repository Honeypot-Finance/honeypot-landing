          DreamPad ensures fair pricing through our innovative Fair Token
          Offering (FTO) model, which includes several key features:
        </p>

        <ul className="pl-[2rem] *:m-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Fair Access:</strong> Uniform pricing across all users
            ensures no single user gains an unfair advantage, promoting
            equitable token distribution.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Immediate Liquidity:</strong> A 100% deep liquidity pool is
            established immediately, enabling instant user trading and improving
            market efficiency and confidence.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>No Pre-minted Tokens:</strong> Tokens exist only within the
            liquidity pool, preventing market manipulation by early investors.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Transparency:</strong> Users who missed the initial sale can
            only purchase tokens through the AMM pool, ensuring transparent and
            fair token distribution.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Anti-Dumping Measures:</strong> The optional token burn
            after liquidity removal demonstrates the project owner's commitment
            to market stability and investor confidence.

          At Honeypot Finance, we prioritize the security and trust of our
          community. To mitigate the risk of rug pulls, we've implemented
          several robust mechanisms:
        </p>

        <ol className="pl-[1rem] *:m-5">
          <li className="list-decimal">
            <strong>Democratic Voting and Pause Mechanism:</strong>
          </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              We believe in the collective wisdom of our community. Our platform
              incorporates a robust democratic voting and pause mechanism,
              allowing users to halt suspicious activities promptly. This helps
              prevent potential rug pulls effectively.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li className="list-decimal">
            <strong>Launch Model:</strong>
          </li>

          <ul className="*:m-5">
            <li>
              Our launch model is designed to make rug pulls economically
              non-viable. Here's how it works:
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Liquidity Pool (LP) Token Launch:</strong>
            </li>

            <ul className="*:m-5">
              <li>
                We launch LP tokens and immediately add them to our HenloDex.
                This approach ensures projects earn transaction fees as LP
                providers, creating a long-term revenue stream.
              </li>

              <li>
                By doing this, projects are not incentivized to dump tokens for
                short-term gains. Instead, they benefit from sustained earnings.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <li>
              <strong>Liquidity Removal and Token Burn Mechanism:</strong>
            </li>

            <ul className="*:m-5">
              <li>
                When a project removes liquidity from the pool, the tokenâ€™s
                value remains stable due to the constant K formula used in our
                Automated Market Maker (AMM) model.
              </li>

              <li>
                Additionally, projects can choose to burn their tokens while
                removing liquidity. This burning mechanism reduces the token
                supply, thereby supporting the token's price.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Our approach ensures that the long-term benefits of maintaining
          liquidity and earning transaction fees outweigh the short-term gains
          from a potential rug pull. This economic incentive structure makes rug
          pulls highly unlikely and aligns the interests of projects with those
          of the community.

              Our platform has robust mechanisms in place to support the success
              of token launches. These include democratic voting, pause

          <ul>
            <li>
              The FTO model creates long-term economic incentives for projects
              by enabling them to earn transaction fees as liquidity providers.
              This discourages short-term, opportunistic behaviors like rug
              pulls.
