            If the vote surpasses a certain threshold, our smart contract, which
            incorporates OpenZeppelin's pause mechanism, can halt the launch.

          DreamPad ensures fair pricing through our innovative Fair Token
          Offering (FTO) model, which includes several key features:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul className="pl-[2rem]">
          <li>
            <strong>Fair Access:</strong> Uniform pricing across all users
            ensures no single user gains an unfair advantage, promoting
            equitable token distribution.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Immediate Liquidity:</strong> A 100% deep liquidity pool is
            established immediately, enabling instant user trading and improving
            market efficiency and confidence.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>No Pre-minted Tokens:</strong> Tokens exist only within the
            liquidity pool, preventing market manipulation by early investors.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Transparency:</strong> Users who missed the initial sale can
            only purchase tokens through the AMM pool, ensuring transparent and
            fair token distribution.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Anti-Dumping Measures:</strong> The optional token burn
            after liquidity removal demonstrates the project owner's commitment
            to market stability and investor confidence.
